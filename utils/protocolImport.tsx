/**
 * Split what came out of a `.netcanvas` into the rows Fresco stores.
 *
 * Structure of an asset in network canvas protocols:
 *   - An asset in the manifest is an object whose key is a UID.
 *   - The ID property is the same as the key (duplicated for convenience :/)
 *   - Name property is the original file name when added to Architect
 *   - Source property is the internal path to the file in the zip, which is a
 *     separate UID + file extension.
 *   - The type property is one of the NC asset types (e.g. 'image', 'video',
 *     etc.)
 * Assets with type 'apikey' are handled differently:
 *   - They are not actually files. The key itself is stored in the value field.
 *
 * Two different documents are involved, deliberately. The bytes come from the
 * archive, and were resolved against the manifest that shipped inside it —
 * that is the only manifest whose `source` values describe entries that
 * actually exist in that zip. The metadata written alongside them comes from
 * the validated protocol, because that is the document being installed: if an
 * upgrade ever restates an asset, the stored row should describe the protocol
 * Fresco will run, not the one the researcher happened to export.
 *
 * The two are joined on the manifest key, which no upgrade rewrites — an
 * upgrade that did would leave every stage's asset reference dangling and fail
 * validation long before reaching here.
